    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Software Developer: Tulip Retail</h2>
    <p class="details-highlight-tulip">
      For my third work term, I worked remotely as a softwave developer at Tulip Retail, but for this term I was on a new team and working on different projects to my previous term.
    </p>
    <p class="details">
      Tulip retail is a software solutions company that is based in Kitchener,
      Ontario and previously had an office in Toronto as well. They provide
      retail software to various companies, mostly luxury retailers. The software
      suite offered by Tulip consists of multiple apps for iPad and iPhone, and 
      provides associates with the tools to manage customer profiles, check customers
      out in store, ship items to customers' homes.

    <p class="details">
      Tulip Retail has numerous customers in the luxury fashion industry, including companies
      like Chanel, Kate Spade, Jimmy Choo, and more.

  <div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">
    <p class="details">
      I continued to work from home for this work term as the Tulip office remained closed for the S21 semester, although I was much more
      accustomed to working from home by the time I started my term.

    <h2 class="featurette-heading">My Job</h2>
    <p class="details-highlight-tulip">
      For this term, I was placed on the Checkout team, and we were responsible for the frontend and backend of the Tulip
      checkout mobile app.
    </p>
    <p class="details">
      The Tulip checkout app is is used by associates to sell products in-store and over the phone directly to customers. Things like product catalogs, 
      inventory, cash drawers, point-of-sale, and payment processing are all the responsibility of the Checkout team.
    </p>
    <p class="details">
      Similarly to my previous term, the main backend work was in PHP. I was much more familiar with PHP this term and was able to hit the ground
      running with the backend work, and by the end of my term I was very comfortable navigating and working in the backend.
    </p>
    <p class="details">
      The frontend portion of my work was in Swift, the native language for iOS development. I was very excited to be doing iOS development on this
      team because I have a personal interest in it and have done some small personal projects with Swift before. Despite my personal experience, production
      Swift code is wildly different than anything I'd seen up until that point so I knew I had a lot to learn if I was going to work competently on
      the front end of Checkout.
    </p>
    <p class="details">
      Since I ended up doing a lot of API work during this term, I'd say that CIS3760 was the most applicable part of my education to this role. That course
      is where I got my first hands-on experience with the structure and development of APIs.

    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Learning Goals</h2>
    <p class="details-highlight-tulip">
      My learning goals this term were all from different categories because I wanted to take as much as I could 
      out of this term, as it was one of my final terms, and Tulip would be the last company I worked with before
      graduating.
    </p>

  <div class="col-md-7 order-md-1">
    <h4>Goal 1: Technological Literacy</h4>
    <p class="details">
      My first learning goal was to be able to competently review a merge request for a full customer integration into the Tulip ecosystem.
      An integration is effectively the customization that needs to be done on a per-customer basis for any new customer to be set up with Tulip.
    </p>
    <p class="details">
      I was able to complete this goal by spending lots of time reviewing, both on my own and in pairs, merge requests from other developers on 
      my team. I was also able to work on a few integrations myself which allowed me to spot any problems that might show up in a new integration MR.
    </p>
    <p class="details">
      By the end of my first term with Tulip I was able to competently review integration MRs as well as any other MR that came my way. This is a very
      important skill to develop because, to be a successful developer, you need to be able to read other people's code and find any potential issues.

  <div class="col-md-7 order-md-3">
    <h4>Goal 2: Depth and Breadth of Understanding</h4>
    <p class="details">
      My second learning goal was to have a solid understanding of the various projects that the Delivery Team worked on. 
    </p>
    <p class="details">
      I was able to complete this goal by picking up work across the full breadth of projects that Delivery works on, such as the
      backend API projects, customer capture, file exporter, etc. By completing this variety of work I was able to understand how 
      each project worked both independently and with other projects.
    </p>
    <p class="details">
      I know I completed my goal because, by the end of my term, I could pick up a ticket from almost anything that Delivery owned
      and quickly know where to look and how I might solve the problem.

  <div class="col-md-7 order-md-5">
    <h4>Goal 3: Personal Learning Goal</h4>
    <p class="details">
      My third learning goal was to be able to take what I learned during this term and apply it to my own projects.
    </p>
    <p class="details">
      Similar to my second goal, the large volume and breadth of the tickets I worked on provided me with the necessary
      tools to take the various things I learned and apply them to my own future projects.
    </p>
    <p class="details">
      Combined with my next co-op term, I will be able to take the backend knowledge from this term and the  mobile development
       knowledge from my next term and apply them to my own projects.

  <h2 class="featurette-heading">Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="details-highlight-tulip">
    My experience on the Delivery Team at Tulip was fantastic. Each and every person I worked with was
    talented, knowledgable, and understanding.
  </p>
  <p class="details">
    Working on this team provided me with a lot of opportunities to grow and learn in a lot of different ways. 
    I was always treated as a full member of the team and got to make some real contributions to the work that
    was being done. 
  </p>
  <p class="details">
    I am extremely glad that Tulip chose to have me for this term and I'm looking forward to spending my next term 
    here with the Checkout team.
